            <h3>Professional Hero</h3>

            <p>
                You might saw me jumping, climbing buildings and stopping trains. But I think that's not what makes me a hero. A hero is he who can be available any time in need of a girl. You can often see me in front of girl's college or, "Jannat apar fuler bagan". Haters like "Bostubadi" Sohan or, "Lover Boy" Ridom can criticize me for my actions. But, I don't have enough time to pay attention to them. Rather, I'm busy to save the women world from the villain like "Valo Manush" Rajib vai. I have to pass a very busy life to cover all the girl's colleges and women workshop. But, I won't mind working hard. Cause I love my profession and that what makes me a real "HERO".

            <h3> Become A World Class Saviour </h3>
            <p> 
                You have probably seen those Hindi or, Tamil movies where the hero can save the heroine with his incredible heroism and inhuman strength. They are okay but one thing I don't like about them is that their main focus is always only on one girl: their heroine. But as a world saviour, I want to be a hero who doesn't limit his heroine number. Cause I think it's a serious crime against the human rights of world women organization. That is why I want to be a world-class saviour who doesn't have any bounds

            <p class="last-p">I started my career as a constable. My main duty was to keep the peace within their assigned jurisdictions. I also have duties that do not pertain to enforcing the law. I could serve as a court processor by serving a summons to a defendant and even serve as a bailiff in a courthouse. I had to deal with some thieves, robbers etc. So, life was not challenging and I became bored. </p>

            <p class="last-p">I've changed my profession as the city needs me badly. The work of being police was also to easy for me. So, I've become a hero of Dhaka city. Some compare me with batman of Gotham city. But I don't think so. Cause most of the work of batman is in underground. But I love to do my duty outside of girls college most. That's my uniqueness and I want to be a world-class hero to continue my honourable job. </p>
